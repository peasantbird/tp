<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer. For more info, check the [FAQ](#faq).

2. Download the latest `rtpm.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-3/tp/releases/tag/v1.4).

3. Move the application to the folder you want to use as the _setup folder_ for RTPM. 
(On startup, the application will generate a few files for configuration and storage.)

4. You should be able to run the application by double-clicking. If this does not work for you, check the [FAQ](#faq).<br>
   A display similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. If you are starting the app for the first time,
 there will be some sample data loaded.<br>
<div style="text-align:center;">
   <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Ui" style="width:500px"/>
</div>


5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `buyer n/John Doe` : Adds a buyer named John Doe to the RTPM.

    * `list` : Lists all buyers and sellers.

    * `bdelete 2` : Deletes the 2nd buyer shown in the current list.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


<br>

## Configuration
If you are looking to change the size of the application, resizing can simply be done by clicking and 
dragging the borders in the direction you desire. 
If you do this to the white header atop the app, you can also move the window around.
Both size and position of the application are saved, so that 
you don't need to spend time fiddling with the window.

<box type="info" seamless>

**For advanced users only:**

You can change the location in which RTPM's data is stored by editing the preferences.json file using any text
editing app of your choice, such as Notepad or Microsoft Word.
Edit the filePath string to the directory that you wish to move it to, relative to the RTPM.jar location. 
Note that backslashes need to be repeated twice.

</box>

## Features

Here are some things regarding RTPM's features to take note of before using them.

<box type="definition" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` represent the parameters, or data, to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `buyer n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `buyer n/John Doe`.

* Prefixes in the format `small_letters/` indicate to RTPM where your data is located. <br>
  e.g. in `buyer n/NAME`, `n/` is a prefix which tells the app that `NAME` is representing a buyer's name.
  You must include a space before the prefix.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* The order in which you input data is not fixed by RTPM.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* All commands and prefixes ignore case. parameters however, are case-sensitive. <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `buyer n/NAME`, `BUYER N/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<box type="definition" seamless>

**General notes about features:**<br>

* RTPM does not require all fields to be filled in when creating buyers or sellers. Fields that have been omitted will be set to RTPM's preset default values.

* RTPM accepts unconventional entries for data values to an extent. However, the warning system informs the user of any valid but possibly unintended inputs. For more information, refer to [Appendix A: Warnings](#appendix-a-warnings)

* The priority system allows for the designation of levels of importance to each buyer and seller, which will be displayed as a tag in RTPM. When this priority is set to `nil`, there will be no tag.

* RTPM data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

* RTPM data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/rtpm.json`.

* Note that RTPM checks for duplicate and similar entries. Refer to [Appendix C: Similar Names](#appendix-c-similar-names) for more info.

* **If you manually make changes to the saved data file such that the JSON format is invalid, RTPM will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
  Hence, manually modifying the saved data file is not recommended.**

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Sorting buyers: `bsort`

Elevate your contact list through organisation based on your priorities.

The `bsort` command allows you to quickly organise your buyer contacts by various criteria, so that you can sieve out
your most important contacts to maintain and the most valuable opportunities you have.

Format: `bsort [PREFIX/DIRECTION]`
* `PREFIX`: Choose <u>one</u> of:
  * `n` - sort by **name**
  * `ah` - sort by **home address**
  * `i` - sort by **house info**
  * `prio` - sort by **priority**
* `DIRECTION`: "a" OR "d" for ascending or descending respectively

<box type="tip">

**Tip:** When no prefix and direction is provided, `bsort` sorts by the list's original order.

</box>

Examples: 
* `bsort` to sort by original order
* `bsort n/d` to sort by name descending

Precise outputs when the command succeeds:

>Got it. I've sorted the buyer list!


Precise outputs when the command fails:
1. For general errors:
>Invalid command format!<br>
bsort: Sorts the buyers in RTPM. Parameters: Choose zero or one of [n/] [ah/] [i/] [prio/] a/d (for ASC/DESC)<br>
Example: bsort prio/d
2. When the same prefix is used more than once:
>Multiple values specified for the following single-valued field(s): ...

<box type="info">

**Note:**

* The sort command will ignore any extraneous inputs and invalid prefixes after the `bsort` keyword and before the next 
valid prefix (`n`, `ah`, `i` or `prio`).
  * For example, `bsort qwerty z/asdf prio/d` will execute `bsort prio/d`.
  * Any extraneous inputs or invalid prefixes after a valid prefix will cause an error.
* When two or more valid prefixes are provided, `bsort` will sort by only one of the provided prefixes, which is chosen
  based on this order:<br> **1. Name**, **2. Home address**, **3. House info**, **4. Priority**.
  * For example, `bsort prio/d n/d` will execute `bsort n/d`.

</box>

### Sorting sellers: `ssort`

Elevate your contact list through organisation based on your priorities.

The `ssort` command allows you to quickly organise your seller contacts by various criteria, so that you can sieve out
your most important contacts to maintain and the most valuable opportunities you have.

Format: `ssort [PREFIX/DIRECTION]`
* `PREFIX`: Choose <u>one</u> of:
    * `n` - sort by **name**
    * `ah` - sort by **home address**
    * `i` - sort by **house info**
    * `prio` - sort by **priority**
* `DIRECTION`: "a" OR "d" for ascending or descending respectively

<box type="tip">

**Tip:** When no prefix and direction is provided, `ssort` sorts by the list's original order.

</box>

Examples:
* `ssort` to sort by default
* `ssort n/d` to sort by name descending

Precise outputs when the command succeeds:

>Got it. I've sorted the seller list!


Precise outputs when the command fails:
1. For general errors:
>Invalid command format!<br>
ssort: Sorts the sellers in RTPM. Parameters: Choose zero or one of [n/] [ah/] [i/] [prio/] a/d (for ASC/DESC)<br>
Example: ssort prio/d
2. When the same prefix is used more than once:
>Multiple values specified for the following single-valued field(s): ...

<box type="info">

**Note:**

* Similar to `bsort`, the `ssort` command will also ignore any extraneous inputs and invalid prefixes after the `ssort` keyword and before the next
  valid prefix (`n`, `ah`, `i` or `prio`).
* Similar to `bsort`, when two or more valid prefixes are provided, `ssort` will sort by only one of the provided prefixes, which is chosen
  based on this order: <br> **1. Name**, **2. Home address**, **3. House info**, **4. Priority**.

## FAQ

A list of frequently asked questions to resolve common issues you may have.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous RTPM home folder.

**Q**: My entries are missing! Did they get deleted somehow?<br>
**A**: One possible fix is to try calling the `list` command. If you manually edit the data file, or you filtered the list,
the entries may not appear in the application until you refresh the list.

**Q**: I made a mistake! How do I fix it?<br>
**A**: You can make use of the handy [undo](#undoing-previous-action-undo) and [redo](#redoing-previous-action-redo)
commands to fix any errors made.

**Q**: I can't double-click on the application to run it! <br>
**A**: First, check that you have Java 11 installed. If you do, and you still can't double-click, try this:
Open a command terminal,use the `cd` command to change into the folder you put the application file in,
and type in the `java -jar rtpm.jar`command to run the application.

**Q**: How do I install Java 11? <br>
**A**: Try installing from the official Oracle archive [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).

**Q**: I still have issues! <br>
**A**: Try contacting our developer team by creating an issue on our 
[GitHub](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-3/tp/issues), and we will see how we can help.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. Adding multiple contacts with excessively long names (>5000 characters) may cause RTPM to lag significantly. It is recommended to use nicknames or initials if necessary.
3. Long fields can cause the details of a client to not be displayed fully. A workaround is to use the 
```slist```/```blist``` commands to display the details of the client in the result box.

## Appendix A: Warnings

RTPM allows you to flexibly input most fields of data, so that the app doesn't unnecessarily restrict you.
For example, you can insert chinese characters as names, or
use slashes to abbreviate "son of" as "s/o".

Hence, the warning system aims to inform you of any valid but possibly unintended inputs.
The warning system is able to alert you of multiple errors at once, allowing you to 
correct all mistakes together instead of one-by-one.

The warning system is also used to notify you when
there are two similar buyers or sellers, 
or when a buyer shares the same name as a seller. This reduces the chance that you will 
accidentally make two entries for the same person, cluttering your data.
See [Appendix C](#appendix-c-similar-names) for more details.

<box type="definition">

Here is a non-exhaustive list of some warning messages.

```
Warning!; [Phone numbers should only contain numbers, and it should be at 
least 3 digits long. Area codes are allowed, signified by a '+' and up to 
3 numbers, followed by a space separating this from the main number.]
Please ignore if this is expected.
```
```
Warning!; [Emails should be of the format local-part@domain and adhere to 
the following constraints:
1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these 
special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may 
not start or end with any special characters.
2. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is 
made up of domain labels separated by periods.
The domain name must:
    - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
    - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
    - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated 
      only by hyphens, if any.]
Please ignore if this is expected.

## Appendix C: Similar names
RTPM does checks to ensure users do not accidentally enter the same person twice, preventing cases where you have duplicate entries.
This is also true if you try to edit two people to have the same name.

There may be some ambiguity when names are similar but not exactly the same; in this case,
the app will warn the user in case this was unintentional,
but will not prevent the command from executing. 

<box type="definition">
This section aims to explain how exactly similar names are determined.

RTPM's definition of 'similar' is as follows: Either one of the names is contained 
in the other, or the names require 2 or fewer edits (deletions, insertions, substitutions)
to make them the same. (for more details look for the definition of Levenshtein distance 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance" class="badge bg-primary">here</a>.
</box>

An example when the same name is detected across buyers and sellers: 
```This seller potentially also exists in the buyer list: If so, please verify that their contact information is the same```

An example when similar names are detected:
```The seller is similar to one of the sellers in the list!```

An example when the same name is detected:
```This seller already exists in the address book```
(This is not allowed, hence the command will not execute.)
