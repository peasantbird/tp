### Project: RealtorTrackerPlusMax

RealtorTrackerPlusMax is a desktop application made for usage by real estate agents to keep track of their
contacts, such as buyers and sellers.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java,
and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to display the information of individual buyers and sellers in the output box.
  * Justification: This allows the user to copy the information to be used elsewhere when required. This also mitigates the issue of text overflowing the UI since it can still be viewed using this command.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=andytoh1&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=andytoh1&tabRepo=AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed v1.4 iteration
    * Decided on and assigned issues

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Made the `buyer` and `seller commands work with incomplete fields since users are not likely to possess all details immediately
  * Made the `list` and `filter` commands work for 2 lists
  * Made the `add` command work for sellers

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for `filter`, `list`, `blist`, `slist` commands
    * Added contents page
    * Added hyperlinks for navigability
    * Improved formatting for readability
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added planned enhancements
